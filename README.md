## Function / purpose

Finding a way to absorb information from a video as fast as humanely possible.

## Road map / walk through video

Segment the voiced and silent parts of a video or audio with parameters such as the energy threshold and the duration threshold.

For the voiced part, dynamically adjust the rate of speech based on the user-defined target of the rate of speech.

The silent part is accelerated at a very fast rate, and it will be directly cut off if the silence duration is greater than a threshold.
